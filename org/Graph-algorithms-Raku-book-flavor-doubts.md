# Graph algorithms Raku book flavor doubts

## What and why?

A consider writing a Raku book on graph algorithms utilization _or_ implementation.

If the book is for "end users" of graph algorithms then the title would be:

**0.** **Retro Graph Algorithms with Raku**

If the book is for (Raku) developers of graph algorithms then the title would be:

**1.** ***Postmodern Development of Graph Algorithms for Raku***

## Preference indication request

Which one would be interested in? Please:

- *Downvote* this post for flavor **0.**

- *Upvote* this post for flavor **1.**


-------

## Retro Graph Algorithms with Raku

That book discusses industry or everyday problems treated with *classical* graph algorithms.

(See the graph-related videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/@AAA4prediction).)

-------

## Postmodern Development of Graph Algorithms for Raku

That book discusses how to reliably and fast prototype, visualize, develop, and test graph algorithms with and for Raku.

(See the TODO list [here](https://github.com/antononcube/Raku-Graph).)

-------

## Both books

For both flavors I plan to provide:

- Chapters as Markdown files, Jupyter notebooks, and Mathematica notebooks

- At least 7-8 tutorial presentations
