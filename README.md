# RetroGraphAlgorithmsWithRaku-book

A book on graph algorithms development and examples with Raku.

I am not sure how to name this book. If the book is for "end users" of graph algorithms then the current title:

***Retro Graph Algorithms with Raku***

is fine.

If the book is for (Raku) developers of graph algorithms then the title:

***Postmodern Development of Graph Algorithms for Raku***

is more appropriate.
